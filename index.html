            <p class="sectionSubTag">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major
                “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which
                almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a
                practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.

                I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else
                it might turn out to be too late.
